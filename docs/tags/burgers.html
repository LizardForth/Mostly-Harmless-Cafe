      <h2>Blue Cheese Burger</h2>
      <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 lb ground beef (20%+ fat)</li>
<li>hamburger buns</li>
<li>jalapeno (sliced, ⅛ inch)</li>
<li>yellow onion (sliced as thin as you can)</li>
<li>⅓ cup of blue cheese crumbles
<ul>
<li>if you&rsquo;re using a solid block, cut off enough to stack on a burger about ¼ inch high</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>blackened seasoning</li>
<li>buffalo sauce of choice</li>
<li>salt &amp; pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>On medium heat, toast the inner side of the buns with olive oil. About 2½-3 minutes is usually enough.</li>
<li>Increase pan heat to med-high. Season your patty generously with salt and pepper, place on the skillet, and top with the sliced onions.</li>
<li>Aggressively press the patty onto the skillet (onions should be pressed into the burger by doing this). Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Flip. Top with jalapenos, followed by blue cheese, followed by blackened seasoning (enough to cover). Cover and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Place patty on bun, top with however much buffalo sauce you want, let rest for 2 minutes, serve.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="optional">Optional:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fry the jalapenos first by using a basic dredge and then placing in shallow oil.</li>
<li>Put a bit of <a href="phisch-bbq-sauce.html">Phisch&rsquo;s BBQ Sauce</a> on the bottom bun before adding the patty.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Jalapeno Cheddar Burger</h2>
      <h2 id="ingredients-beef">Ingredients (beef):</h2>
<p>I know that American Cheese isn&rsquo;t very popular with a lot of people but it melts better than most other cheeses so it&rsquo;s good for putting on top of other ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li>½ pound ground beef</li>
<li>1 slice of cheddar cheese</li>
<li>1 slice of american cheese (subst. whatever cheese you want)</li>
<li>1 jalapeno (sliced to desired thickness)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ingredients-sauce">Ingredients (sauce):</h2>
<p>This is about enough sauce for 10 burgers so put the difference in a box or something.</p>
<ul>
<li>½ Tbsp mayonnaise</li>
<li>¼ Tbsp ketchup</li>
<li>¼ Tbsp mustard</li>
<li>¼ tsp salt</li>
<li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
<li>¼ pickle (finely diced)</li>
<li>¼ onion (diced and browned)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to go ahead and make the sauce but wait until the first patty is done before applying it to the buns.</p>
<h2 id="instructions-sauce">Instructions (sauce):</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mix it all together.</li>
<li>Put as much as you want on the inside of both buns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking I usually do 1.5 minutes cooked on one side and 1 minute on the other for medium doneness, but this may not always be the case. Use whatever timing/temperature you are comfortable with.</p>
<h2 id="instructions-burger">Instructions (burger):</h2>
<ol>
<li>Distribute the ½ lb of ground beef between two patties.</li>
<li>Apply generous amounts of salt and pepper to both sides of patties.</li>
<li>Press first patty onto skillet set to high</li>
<li>Cook for about 1.5 minutes or to desired doneness.</li>
<li>Flip, put a layer of jalapenos on the patty with a slice of American Cheese (or subst.) on top.</li>
<li>Cook for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Place patty on sauced bun.</li>
<li>Press second patty onto skillet set to high.</li>
<li>Cook for 1.5 minutes.</li>
<li>Flip, put a layer of cheddar cheese on top.</li>
<li>Cook for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Place on previously cooked patty.</li>
<li>Cover with other sauced bun.</li>
</ol>
