## Ingredients (pasta):

- 120g pasta (spaghetti, dry)

## Ingredients (sauce):

- &frac14; cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 anchovy
- 12 cherry tomatoes (halved)
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- &frac12; tsp pepper
- &frac12; tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- shredded Pecorino Romano

The Pecorino will be garnish so just grate however much you think you'll need. <br>
You can also add in some chicken. If you do, marinade it with garlic powder, ground ginger, lemon juice, and salt for around 30-45 minutes, cook, and set aside for later.

## Instructions:

Start boiling pasta around the time you start making the sauce. <br>
Reserve a cup-ish of pasta water in case it's needed later.

1. Put garlic, olive oil, and anchovy to pan on medium heat, cook until garlic is slightly brown.
2. Add tomatoes, toss (also throw in chicken if you made some).
3. Add cooked pasta, toss.
4. Add red pepper, salt, and black pepper.

If the salt and red/black pepper are having trouble mixing, add a little of the reserved pasta water to help it mix.

5. Add lemon juice, toss.
6. Garnish with Pecorino Romano.
