## Ingredients (Noodles):
- 1 lb wide rice noodles
- 5 cloves of garlic (minced)
- 1 inch knob of ginger (minced)
- 3 shallots (thinly sliced longways)
- 2 scallions (sliced, 1-inch slices)
- 7 Thai red chili peppers (thinly sliced)
    - use more if you want it to be spicier
- 2 cups Thai basil
- 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
    - subst: rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp chili oil

## Ingredients (beef):
- 1&frac12; lbs beef (thinly sliced)
- &frac12; tsp salt
- &frac14; cup soy sauce

## Ingredients (sauce):
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 4 tsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 4 tsp oyster sauce
- &frac12; tsp ground white pepper

## Instructions:
1. Mix beef with salt and let marinade in soy sauce until needed.
1. Prepare noodles using instructions on box/bag.
    - this may take up to an hour so go ahead and finish this before moving on.
1. Prepare sauce by mixing all sauce ingredients together and setting to the side.
1. In wok on high heat, sear beef. Don't cook all the way, just long enough to sear. Remove beef and set aside.
1. Reduce heat to medium and add vegetable oil followed by garlic and ginger. Cook until garlic slightly browns.
1. Add shallots, scallions, chili peppers, basil, and shaoxing wine. Toss. Cook until basil wilts.
1. Increase temperature to high and add noodles and sauce. Continuously mix for around 1&frac12; minutes.
1. Add beef, continuously mix until noodles reach consistency you like.
1. Add chili oil and mix for 30 more seconds.
1. Serve immediately.

### Optional:
- If you get to the end and find it's still not spicy enough, add more chili oil.
- When reheating, heat skillet to medium-high, add 1 tbsp of chili oil, add desired amount of noodles, and toss until heated. This is better than microwaving.
