Pretty basic spaghetti and meatballs recipe. It started as Joshua Weissman's spaghetti and meatballs from his "But Cheaper" series but I changed meatballs and sauce a bit. It's still probably at least 60% his recipe but I like to make this one because ginger is easier to find than basil and I love squeezing anchovies into any recipe I can find.

## Ingredients
- Meatballs:
    - &frac18; lb bologna (diced){{< super "1" >}}
        - subst: &frac14; lb sausage
    - 1 lb ground beef (20% fat or more)
    - 1 tsp ground fennel seeds
        - subst: ground anise seeds
    - 1 &frac34; tsp sea salt
    - 3 cloves of garlic (minced)
    - 2 inch knob of ginger (minced)
    - &frac14; cup Pecorino Romano (finely shredded)
    - fresh cracked blackpepper (to taste)
    - &frac12; cup of panko
    - 1 whole egg
- Sauce:
    - &frac14; cup extra virgin olive oil
    - 2 oz. can of anchovies {{< super "2" >}}
    - 4 cloves garlic (minced)
    - 2 inch knob of ginger (minced or julienne)
    - 1 tsp red pepper flakes
    - t tsp salt
    - 2 cans (28 oz.) crushed tomatoes

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, mix together all of the meatball ingredients until homogenous, then separate into 20 equal-sized pieces and roll into balls.
1. In a pot on med-high heat, sear the meatballs{{< super "3" >}}. Place to side after searing.
1. Reduce heat to medium and add the olive oil to the pot.
1. Add anchovies and let saute until anhovies dissolve, then add garlic and let saute until fragrant.
1. Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer.
    - additional salt to taste
1. Add red pepper flakes and meatballs, cook for around 30 minutes {{< super "4" >}}.
1. Add noodles, toss until thoroughly combined {{< super "5" >}}.
1. Garnish with pecorino and serve.

## Footnotes
{{< footnote "1" "If you use ham instead of bologna you can use &frac14; lb because it's denser so the same mass would give you fewer pieces." >}}
{{< footnote "2" "Use anchovies that come in oil, not vinegar." >}}
{{< footnote "3" "Don't worry to much about the meatballs cooking all the way through. Just worry about getting a good sear. They'll finish cooking while simmering in the sauce later." >}}
{{< footnote "4" "Cooking for longer is going to reduce the sauce more, making it more robust and rich. You can cook it for 10-15 minutes to get the meatballs cooked but it won't taste as good and might even be a bit acidic." >}}
{{< footnote "5" "I personally don't like mixing in all the noodles at once. I like Making the noodles per serving because if you have leftovers, the noodles don't keep as well (they bloat) while the sauce only gets better." >}}
