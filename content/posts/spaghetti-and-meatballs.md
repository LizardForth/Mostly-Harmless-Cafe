description: Pretty basic spaghetti and meatballs recipe. It started as Joshua Weissman's spaghetti and meatballs from his "But Cheaper" series but I changed meatballs and sauce a bit. It's still probably at least 60% his recipe but I like to make this one because ginger is easier to find than basil and I love squeezing anchovies into any recipe I can find.

    1. Separate the beef mixture into 20 equal-sized pieces and roll into balls.
    1. In a pot on med-high heat, sear the meatballs{{< super "3" >}}. Place to side after searing.

    1. Reduce heat to medium and add the olive oil to the pot.

## Footnotes
{{< footnote "1" "You can also use &frac14; lb of ground sausage, &frac14; lb of ham, or &frac18; lb of bologna" >}}
{{< footnote "2" "Use anchovies that come in oil, not vinegar." >}}
{{< footnote "3" "Don't worry to much about the meatballs cooking all the way through. Just worry about getting a good sear. They'll finish cooking while simmering in the sauce later." >}}
{{< footnote "4" "Cooking for longer is going to reduce the sauce more, making it more robust and rich. You can cook it for 10-15 minutes to get the meatballs cooked but it won't taste as good and might even be a bit acidic." >}}
{{< footnote "5" "This is enough sauce for around 1 lb of dry noodles; however, I personally don't like mixing in all the noodles at once. I like Making the noodles per serving because if you have leftovers, the noodles don't keep as well (they bloat) while the sauce only gets better." >}}
