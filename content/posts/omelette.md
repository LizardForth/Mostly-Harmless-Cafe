# Ingredients
- Eggs:
    1. 4 whole eggs
    1. 1 tbsp of italian parsley (finely chopped)
- Filling:
    1. &frac18; lb ground sausage
    1. Cayenne pepper (preferred amount)
    1. 1 jalapeno (chopped, &frac18;<sup>th</sup> inch)
    1. 2 tbsp onion (chopped, &frac18;<sup>th</sup> inch)
    1. 1 small russet potato (chopped, &frac18;<sup>th</sup> inch)
    1. Olive oil
    1. 1 tbsp of unsalted butter
    1. Sharp cheddar cheese (freshly shredded, preferred amount)
    1. Asiago cheese (freshly shredded, preferred amount)

# Instructions
- Eggs:
    1. Crack all 4 eggs into a bowl and mix using a fork. When mixing, try not to be too aggressive as to not over-mix the eggs.
    1. After they're well mixed, add the chopped parsley and stir to combine.
    1. Set to the side.
- Potatoes:
    1. Chop potato and soak in water for 1 minute. Rinse, dry, and cover in olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste.
    1. Using an air fryer set to 450&deg;F, add potatoes, stir around, and let cook for 10 minutes. After that, stir the potatoes around and cook for another 10 minutes. 
    1. If they're still not browned and crusty with a fluffy inside, cook them for a few more minutes; otherwise, remove them from the air fryer and set to the side.
- Veggies:
    1. To medium non-stick skillet on medium heat, add a bit of olive oil and when the skillet comes to temp, add the chopped onions. Let cook for about 1 minute or until the onions are lightly cooked.
    1. Add the chopped jalapenos and cook until fragrant.
    1. Remove jalapenos and onions and set to the side.
- Sausage:
    1. Flatten the sausage on a surface and add a little bit of cayenne pepper.
    1. Using same pan as before on medium heat, cook each side of sausage until brown and chop into pieces using a spatula (or any non-stick friendly utensil).
    1. Remove from pan onto a paper towel, trying to keep as much grease in the pan as possible.
- Cooking and Assembly:
    1. Apply medium-low heat to the pan and add butter. After butter has been fully melted, add the eggs.
    1. Constantly and gently stir the eggs so that you're essentially cooking wet scrambled eggs. Try to keep the consistency as even as possible.
    1. When the eggs are cooked to the point that they're still wet but no longer flowing, remove from heat and with a spatula, smooth over the surface so that the eggs are spread evenly throughout the entire bottom of the pan, forming a disc with the eggs.
    1. Add onions and jalapenos to one half of the disc.
    1. Add potatoes followed by the asiago cheese.
    1. Add sausage followed by the cheddar cheese.
    1. Add the skillet back to the heat and continue cooking until the bottom is done enough to maintain its form.
    1. Loosen up the bottom of the omelette by delecately scraping the bottom with the spatula. Try and get all the omelette to the point where it slides in unison if you shake the pan.
    1. Slide the omelette onto a plate, stopping a little over half-way, after which use the spatula to scoop the rest off the skillet so that it folds over itself.
    1. If it doesn't fold over perfectly you can sometimes use your hands (if it's not too hot) or a spatula to slide it the rest of the way.
