A basic hollandaise sauce, creamy and slightly acidic. Good for eggs benedict and pretty much anything else served at brunch.

# Ingredients
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tsp of cayenne pepper (plus additional for garnish)
- juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tbsp dijon mustard
- &frac12; cup of butter (melted)
- chives (garnish)

# Instructions
1. Melt butter in pan and keep reasonably hot without bringing it to smoke.
1. Add egg yolks to medium-sized metal bowl. Beat with whisk until consistent.
1. To the bowl add the dijon mustard, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. Mix until combined.
1. Continue aggressively whisking and steadily stream in the hot butter. Keep whisking until the mix is consistent and no loose butter/oil can be seen.
1. The current mixture should, more or less, be able to coat the back of a spoon. If it can't or you would like for it to be thicker, take the bowl with the hollandaise in it and whisk it while setting it on and off of the pot of simmering water. This will reduce it. Don't keep it over the pot for too long at a time because the eggs will cook.
1. With thermos, empty out hot water, fill with hollandaise, seal, and set aside.
