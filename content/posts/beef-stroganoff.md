This recipe calls for noodles but the sauce can be put on pretty much everything from bread to potatoes. It's best served topped with sour cream and garnished with parsley. This recipe is enough for roughly a pound of dry egg noodles but it's recommended that you make it to keep and make the noodles per serving. Sauce keeps really well, cooked noodles not so much.

## Ingredients:
- &frac14; cup butter (divide into 2)
- 1&frac12; lbs thin sliced chuck (~&frac14;inch)
- salt & pepper
- 1 yellow onion (sliced)
- 1 lb bella mushrooms (sliced)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- &frac12; cup white wine
  - subst: &frac12; cup vegetable stock and 1 tbsp white vinegar
- 2 cups beef stock
- 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
- 3&frac12; tbsp all-purpose flour
- &frac12; cup sour cream
  - opt: set aside additional for topping

## Instructions:
1. Cover meat in salt and pepper.
2. In dutch oven on med-high heat melt half of the divisions of butter and sear the meat. About 2 minutes per side.
3. After all meat is seared take out meat and set aside.
4. Reduce heat to medium and add the other half of the butter.
5. After butter is melted add mushrooms and onions. Cook until mushrooms are done and onions are translucent.
6. Add garlic, stir for around 1 more minute.
7. Add white wine and while it's deglazing scrape the remnants off the bottom of the pot. Cook for 3 minutes or until you can't smell the booze anymore.
8. In a separate bowl, mix together the beef stock, flour, and Worcestershire sauce. Add to dutch oven along with the beef and let simmer for about 25 minutes, stirring occassionally.
9. Stir in sour cream.
10. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
