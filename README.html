<h1>MostlyHarmless Cookbook</h1>

<p>The goal of this website is to have a community-written cookbook that people can easily use and contribute to at their leisure. The goal is to have a modern, minimal interface with no ads and no 3-page stories about how you grew up with your mother making this recipe every time you fell off your bike and cried. It's also to be designed so that it can be read anywhere with a mobile-friendly interface.</p>

<p>When contributing please use the sample provided in /recipes. Pictures for the recipes are fine but please make them as professional as possible without PII.</p>
